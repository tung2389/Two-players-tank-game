- P5.js uses Cartesian coordinate system, but it is reversed along the y-axis. (0,0) can be found at the top left with the positive direction to the right horizontally and down vertically.

- The p5 rotate() function will rotate the coordinate system (the coordinate with reversed y-axis). With positive angle, it will rotate objects in clockwise direction and with negative angle the rotation is counter-clockwise.

- Angle system in p5:

Positive angle - clockwise, negative angle - counter-clockwise
